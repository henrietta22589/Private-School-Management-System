# Private School Management System
The aim of this project was to create from scratch a Private School's management page in order to practice my C# skills as well as have a little bit of fun coding :)

Check out the architectural design principles of my application here: https://github.com/henrietta22589/Private-School-Management-System/blob/main/ReadMe-C%23%20Architecture.pdf

P.S. this is an exercise from The C# PeopleCert Bootcamp, a 6-month course (500 hrs) that aims to provide a complete path for students to go from zero to employed as web developers while working with other students along the way. Check this out: (https://peoplecerteducation.org/bootcamp/)
